## Project Overview
  [Realty](https://realty-app.netlify.app) is a proof of concept solution for crypto-based real estate purchase/payments with stablecoins. It builds on the idea of having another option for asset listing, investment, saving and payments in the real-estate ecosystem.

## User Story 
- Users can submit their assset for public lusting
- Users can then mint the asset as an NFT to make the asset available to the public for buying.
- Users can see assets available on the platform in "Featured Properties"
- Users can see purchase assets or save up towards paying for the asset.
- Users can see what asset has been bought by either them or someone else.

## Tools Used
- Hardhat
- Openzeppelin contracts 
- React js.
- Ethers.js
- Polygon (mumbai) chain


## Problems encountered
- Verification of property authenticity.

## Current workaround to encountered problem.
- Collect a listing fee from users while listing to reduce the incentive for fraud and also give users the option to report a suspicious listed asset.
