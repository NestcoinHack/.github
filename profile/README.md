## Project Overview
  [Realty](https://realty-app.netlify.app) is a proof of concept solution for crypto-based real estate purchase/payments with stablecoins. It builds on the idea of having another option for asset listing, investment, saving and payments in the real-estate ecosystem.

## Project track 
 - Creator Track 
    - Stablecoins can be used for asset payments and listing, current support is only our test coin â€” [TUSDT](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4A80319043e4f56562212C10Ad86cDe28083cB10) which you can request for from any team member. Further development of the project for mainstream usage will involve mainnet stablecoins like USDT, DAI etc.

    - NFTs are used for verifying listed assets authenticity on Realty and also as proof of ownership of an asset within Realty.

## User Story 
- Users can submit their assset for public lusting
- Users can then mint the asset as an NFT to make the asset available to the public for buying.
- Users can see assets available on the platform in "Featured Properties"

- Users can see what asset has been bought by either them or someone else.
